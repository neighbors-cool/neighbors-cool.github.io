        When I was in the process of earning my Master's degree, I took a machine learning course. In this course, we each had to come up with a class project; I chose to create a neural network. The
        neural network that I built tries to guess the university that a student will choose to transfer to based on data about that student. The neural network learns by looking at a subset of
        attributes about a student and their choices. After the neural network has guessed the choice of a student, it uses the training data to get the correct answer and update each of the nodes
        that lead it to that choice, right or wrong, using back-propagation.

    To train a neural network, you need a lot of data. I chose to use anonymous student statistics from the
    <a href="https://www.transferology.com" title="Transferology.com">Transferology.com</a> website. I went through several iterations of the neural network before settling on the final project, that
