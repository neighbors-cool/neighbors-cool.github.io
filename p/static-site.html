        When I started working on projects locally, I was keeping them in folders on my desktop. I decided that I would create a website to post these projects, and seeing that
        <a href="https://github.com/" title="GitHub Site">GitHub</a> allows you to host a static website for free, it was an obvious choice.

          <source type="image/jpeg" srcset="/img/github.png" />
          <img src="/img/github.png" alt="GitHub Project Page" class="image-md" async loading="lazy" decoding="async" />

    I used a template generator called
    <a href="http://www.initializr.com/" title="Initializr">Initializr</a>. It allows you to download a new HTML5 boilerplate template in either Classic, Responsive, or Bootstrap; I customized the
    options before downloading my template. After unzipping the package, I updated several of the files to be my own and represent the site I wanted to build. I created the favicon for the site using
    <a href="https://realfavicongenerator.net/" title="Real Favicon Generator">Real Favicon Generator</a>, which creates the images and favicon required for several devices, including mobile. After I
    dropped in the HTML and JS files for the home page, bio page, and some of the HTML5 Canvas games that I had worked on, I initialized the project as a new
    <a href="https://github.com/" title="GitHub Site">GitHub</a> project using <a href="https://desktop.github.com/" title="GitHub Desktop">GitHub Desktop</a>.
    <hr class="hr-mid" />
    <a href="https://github.com/" title="GitHub Site">GitHub</a> provides great documentation for starting a static sites at <a href="https://pages.github.com/" title="GitHub Pages">GitHub Pages</a>.
    You only need to create a new repository with the username of your account ending with .github.io. Then, clone the repository to your local machine. After completing these steps I copied the
    Initializr project into the repo and pushed the changes into <a href="https://github.com/" title="GitHub Site">GitHub</a> using
    <a href="https://desktop.github.com/" title="GitHub Desktop">GitHub Desktop</a>. In the repository settings, you can customize several features, security alerts, set a custom domain, and enable
    HTTPS.
    <hr class="hr-mid" />
    I purchased and set up a custom domain using
    <a href="https://domains.google.com" title="Google Domains">Google Domains</a>, including setting up the CNAME to point to the
    <a href="https://github.com/" title="GitHub Site">GitHub</a>
    repo, email domain key for
    <a href="https://protonmail.com/" title="Proton Mail">ProtonMail</a>, and other records required for the DNS.
    <hr class="hr-mid" />
    Since setting up this static site, I work on the projects locally, commit the changes with
    <a href="https://desktop.github.com/" title="GitHub Desktop">GitHub Desktop</a>, and
    <a href="https://github.com/" title="GitHub Site">GitHub</a>
    automatically pushes the changes to the static site, up to a couple of times a day.
